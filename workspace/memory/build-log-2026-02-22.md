- Set up 4 cron jobs on 18.209.247.78:

- Verified all jobs active via `openclaw cron list`
- Ollama stopped (as per constraints), cron jobs use isolated sessions

2026-02-23 02:00Z — [Kimi] Part 10: Skills created on remote server
- Added `SKILL.md` files on `18.209.247.78` under `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/`:
  - `morning-brief` (CST daily brief: disk/memory/uptime/gateway status + pending tasks + cost placeholder)
  - `web-research` (multi-source research with citations, confidence, save to `workspace/research/TOPIC-DATE.md`)
  - `github-push-handler` (webhook repo+commit extraction, 2-3 sentence change summary, Telegram-ready notification)
  - `file-organizer` (safe cleanup with `/tmp/openclaw-trash/`, no `rm`)
- Verified paths with: `ls -la ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/*/SKILL.md`

2026-02-23 02:11Z — [Kimi] Part 11: Plugin hooks interaction logger (SQLite)
- Created remote plugin at `~/.openclaw/plugins/interaction-logger/index.ts` on `18.209.247.78`
- Added manifest `~/.openclaw/plugins/interaction-logger/openclaw.plugin.json` so OpenClaw can load plugin from `plugins.load.paths`
- Configured `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` with backup (`cp openclaw.json openclaw.json.bak`) and enabled plugin entry `interaction-logger`
- Verified internal hooks still enabled: `session-memory`, `boot-md`, `bootstrap-extra-files`, `command-logger`
- Restarted `openclaw-gateway.service` and validated plugin load via `openclaw plugins info interaction-logger` (`Status: loaded`)
- Ran smoke test (`openclaw agent --agent main ...`) and confirmed SQLite insert in `ai_interactions` (`ROW_COUNT=1`)

2026-02-23 02:20Z — [Kimi] Part 12: Multi-agent architecture configured (server compatibility mode)
- Server: `18.209.247.78` (`ssh -i ~/.ssh/troy-key-new.pem -p 2222 openclaw@18.209.247.78`)
- Backed up remote config: `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.bak`
- Applied multi-agent config using version-supported schema:
  - `agents.list`: `main`, `deep`, `coder`, `monitor`
  - `bindings`: Telegram routed to `main`
  - `agents.defaults.subagents`: `maxConcurrent=8`, `maxSpawnDepth=2`, `maxChildrenPerAgent=5`
- Compatibility notes:
  - `agents.named` + `agents.routing` rejected by OpenClaw `v2026.2.21-2`
  - per-agent `thinkingDefault` rejected in this version
  - `sandbox.mode: on` rejected; used `sandbox.mode: all` for `coder`
- Verification:
  - `openclaw config get agents.list`
  - `openclaw config get bindings`
  - `openclaw gateway status` → runtime active, RPC probe ok, listening on `127.0.0.1:18789`
  - `openclaw agent --message 'List all named agents you know about' --agent main --session-id multitest1`
